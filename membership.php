				<h5> Mt. Washington &amp; Pairpoint Glass Society</h5>
            
				<div class="line"></div>

				<p>In 1991, thirty glass collectors met in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, to establish the Mt. Washington Art Glass Society.  In 2007, the Society expanded its focus to include Pairpoint Glass.</p>
			
				<h2>Why Join </h2>
				<p>The Mt. Washington &amp; Pairpoint Glass Society promotes connoisseurship, study, research, history, and preservation of the art glasswares made by the Mt. Washington and Pairpoint Glass Companies.</p>
				<h3>The Mt. Washington &amp; Pairpoint Glass Society (MWPGS) Newsletter</h3>
				<p>The Society publishes a quarterly newsletter that is educational, informative, and helpful to all members interested in Mt. Washington and Pairpoint Glass.</p>
				<h3>Annual Seminar</h3>
				<p> The Society holds an annual seminar at various sites throughout the country, usually choosing sites where Mt. Washington and Pairpoint collections are located. Members and prominent glass authorities present programs on Mt. Washington/Pairpoint glass. Members enjoy exchanging experiences, research, and knowledge concerning their special interests.</p>
				<h3>Knowledge</h3>
				<p> Both at annual seminars and through support of scholarship, the Society continues to increase information about Mt. Washington and Pairpoint glass. In 2005, the Antique Collectors' Club, with the assistance of the Old Dartmouth Historical Society - New Bedford Whaling Museum and the Chrysler Museum of Arts, supported the publication of the first volume of the significant and definitive history of Mt. Washington and Pairpoint glass manufacture. Kenneth Morley Wilson, a noted historian of glass manufacture in America, who was long associated with the Corning Museum of Glass and the Henry Ford Museum, contributed fifteen years of research to this opulent and invaluable research tool for scholars, collectors, dealers, and historians. Products discussed in Volume One include early art glasses, Rose Amber, Burmese, Peach Blow, Pearl Satin, Cameo, Coraline, novelties, salts, toothpick holders, pressed and blown wares, lamps and lamp chimneys, lanterns, chandeliers, etc.</p>
				<p> Jane Shadel Spillman, Curator of American Glass at Corning Museum, is completing Volume Two, begun by the late Ken Wilson. This second volume will include chapters on Royal Flemish, Albertine, Crown Milano, Crown Pairpoint (Pairpoint Limoges), Napoli (Neapolitan), Verona, the rich cut glass of the brilliant period, and the cut, engraved, and colored glasses that have been made by Mt. Washington and its successors up to the present day.</p>
				<h3>Fellowship</h3>
				<p> Collectors and connoisseurs of Mt. Washington and Pairpoint glass share a unique love for this most extraordinary glass. Lasting friendships develop quickly.</p>
