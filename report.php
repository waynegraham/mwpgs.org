				<h5>The Mt. Washington & Pairpoint Glass Society<br/>
				18th Annual Seminar, New Bedford, MA 9/10-12/2009</h5>
            
				<div class="line"></div>

				<p>A wonderful time was had by all, in the hometown of Mt. Washington and Pairpoint! That is the feedback from the Mt. Washington and Pairpoint Glass Society Seminar, September 10-12, 2009 in New Bedford. Kirk Nelson planned and implemented the meeting – everything brought smiles to the hardy travelers who came to the city for the 18th MWPGS Seminar.</p>

				<p>The meeting started on Thursday evening at the U. Mass- Dartmouth Art Gallery (the old Star Store building) in the downtown area near the Whaling Museum and the office of the New Bedford Museum of Glass. All enjoyed a pre-exhibit gathering at the gallery and refreshments at a local restaurant, giving the attendees a chance to catch up with glass friends.</p>

				<p>Back at the gallery, we saw the innovative art work produced by the UMass students along with an impressive photo exhibit featuring the work of Josef Sudek, a Polish artist who captured the mood of Poland in the 1950’s and later using photogravure technology.</p>

				<p>Of greatest note, was the outstanding display of art glass organized by Kirk Nelson with representations from various Victorian manufacturers including Mt. Washington, Pairpoint, Tiffany, Steuben, Durand, and Wheeling. This glass was on loan from the collection of the Bennington Museum in Bennington, VT. Kirk’s presentation provided an interesting perspective on Victorian glass history, using the displayed glass as examples, and linking, and differentiating the various glass sources.</p>

				<p>The meeting began Friday with a brief business overview given by Joe Heyman, our President. The Society is exploring an opportunity to hold our 2010 annual meeting in conjunction with the April meeting of the National American Glass Club in Greenwich, Connecticut. The vote at the Seminar was 'yes' to the proposal, which will go out to the membership for approval. Berna Heyman reported on the MWPGS web page (http://mwpgs.org/), and noted that we had over 3000 unique visits during the past year.</p>

				<p>A brief moment of silence and remembrance was held for the 9/11 anniversary and the passing of our energetic and loved member, Eddie Lawson.</p>

				<p>The first talk was given by Jane Shadel Spillman, Curator of American Glass at the Corning Museum of Glass. Jane shared a perspective on the history, time period, and influences that existed when Mt. Washington Glass Company introduced the famous and beautiful products called Royal Flemish. We saw, with no question, why the glass is called “Royal”, as a stained glass window looking onto another, more gentle, time period. From formal antiquities to whimsical medieval animal shapes, the RF glass radiates a glory that only glass can deliver! </p>

				<p>Jane discussed how the changing times produced new glass concepts, from patents to products. The glass was first called Albertine and then Crown Milano.  These highly decorated items brought hundreds of images to life in glass.</p>

				<p>Phil Gardella, an avid and knowledgeable collector of Pairpoint glass, was our next speaker. Phil also brought in 16 Pairpoint chalices, to demonstrate Pairpoint’s wide variety of colors and patterns. It was such a treat to see the same blanks in different colors and decorations.</p>

				<p>Phil illustrated his talk with photographs of many Pairpoint shapes, colors and patterns. Of course, the well-known bubble ball was represented in numerous examples. Of special note were the hollow ball and cased glass examples, some with very highly decorated cuttings as well as with silver overlay.</p>

				<p>Glass historian, Diane Tobin, brought a new glass artist to our attention – Carl V. Helmschmied (1863-1934), who worked at many of the major glass companies on the east coast. She first shared the interconnections among the many glass and metal companies of the time, including Meriden Britannia, Meriden Flint Glass, New England Glass, Monroe, Pairpoint, Wavecrest, and Belle Ware, the company Helmschmied started.  It was fascinating to see how artists moved from company to company during the time period of 1870 – 1900. Diane located the last workshop used by Carl in Meriden, CT. The workshop was behind his home and still stands today. Interestingly, her research discovered that address numbers changed over time, making the location of the workshop into a project for a sleuth. Carl employed up to 10 women decorating glass. He was a very innovative person, inventing an illuminated flower pot in addition to other glass designs.</p>

				<p>Kirk Nelson, Executive Director, The New Bedford Museum of Glass, shared a large number of images of glass and placed the items in an historical perspective. Once again, the use of U.S. patents to protect innovation was shown to be a critical part of future successes. Sicilian or Lava glass was given as an example, protected by patent # 220,038 (1879).</p>

				<p>We were very fortunate to have Dorothy Hogan-Schofield, Curator of Glass, The Sandwich Glass Museum, as the next speaker. It was a very busy time for the Sandwich community, as they were hosting the annual Sandwich glass show that weekend. Dottie started the story in 1825, with the 1st glass piece made by the company. She discussed the evolving designs of the Sandwich company as it developed the world famous glass, from mold-blown to paperweight glass. During its great history, Sandwich produced items that are now treasured and widely sought after.</p>

				<p>After the talks, the group reconvened for a spirited banquet dinner at the Candleworks restaurant, just down the street from Louis St. Aubin’s old shop, Brookside Antiques. The dinner was great, with the festivities and discussions passing into the late evening. </p>

				<p>Saturday, the meeting moved to Cape Cod with an enjoyable bus ride to the Sandwich Glass Show/Sale. Many of the MWPGS members helped in the U.S. economic recovery, by bringing home glass that they just could not leave behind. After 2 hours at the show, the visitors went to a fabulous restaurant at the Cape Cod Canal, and enjoyed fine seafood and other fare.</p>

				<p>The next stop was the Sandwich Glass Museum – a necessary place of pilgrimage for those who understand Sandwich’s special place in glass history. The museum has modernized its displays and tells the story with finesse and richness of detail.</p>

				<p>Next visit was the modern Pairpoint Glass Company to see what is being produced today. Once again, many of the MWPGS Team stood up to the plate to help the economy! In fact, MWPGS announces a special opportunity based on an agreement between the Society and The Pairpoint Company. Thanks to inroads by Carl Barron, the Society will have a special glass item made by Pairpoint available for our current and future members. Tune in for more information soon.</p>

				<p>Saturday evening was special, an unplanned dinner at the Huttleston House restaurant graciously initiated by Carl Barron. What a perfect close to this intimate Seminar event for MWPGS. The warmth and friendship within this organization is a tribute to all those who enjoy New Bedford glass, and wish to share their interest with others. </p>

				<p>Glass is fragile, as is knowledge of glass. Past history literally grows within our membership, and is shared throughout the Society. The legacy of our members is passed on to the new members and enhances the understanding and appreciation of this great glass period. Our Seminars are one instrument we use to continue this legacy – and continue our friendships between individuals and glass.  See you at the next meeting!</p>
